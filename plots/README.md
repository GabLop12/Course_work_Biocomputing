# Image Plotting Function

The function loads a 3D array from a file named "all_images.npz", selects the first 2D array from the 3D array and creates a list of 2D arrays by looping over the remaining 2D arrays in the 3D array. Then, the function generates a random permutation of the indices of the list of 2D arrays, selects N images from the list using the permuted indices, and displays each image in a subplot along with its title.
* Note: It needs to import libraries (NumPy and Matplotlib).
