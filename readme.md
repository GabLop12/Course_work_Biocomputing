# Cryo-EM data "Particle picker"

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful imaging technique used to study biological macromolecules at near-atomic resolution. In cryo-EM experiments, a beam of electrons is fired at a frozen sample, and the resulting images are used to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sample.

Particle picking is an important step in cryo-EM data processing, where individual particle images are identified from the raw cryo-EM images. The goal of particle picking is to extract high-quality images of individual particles for further processing.
